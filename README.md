# Chaos Theory Experiment

### Description:

This program illustrates a very simple but interesting chaos theory experiment. The experiment shows how there can be order in chaos. While performing this experiment we have to follow just 3 steps:

1. Place 3 points, not colinear, on the workarea.
2. Inside the triangle formed by the 3 points, chose a point(index) at random.
3. Now choose any of the 3 original points (vertices of the triangle) and move the index halfway from current positon to the selected vertex. Repeat from step 3 with new postion of the index.

Thats it! This seemingly simple process produces a very interesting(slightly creepy) result.
